Specifically, we apply this model class to explain the weekly hospitalization for respiratory diseases in Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil, by incorporating climate and pollution as covariates, trend and seasonality. The main feature of this model class is its capability of considering a set of explanatory variables with linear and nonlinear structures, which allows, for example, to model jointly trend and seasonality of a time series with additive functions for the nonlinear explanatory variables and a predictor to accommodate discrete and linear explanatory variables. Additionally, the conditional symmetric errors allow the possibility of fitting data with high correlation order, as well as error distributions with heavier or lighter tails than the normal ones. We present the model class and a novel iterative process is derived by combining a P-GAM type algorithm with a quasi-Newton procedure for the parameter estimation. The inferential results, diagnostic procedures, including conditional quantile residual analysis and local influence analysis for sensitivity, are discussed. Simulation studies are performed to assess finite sample properties of parametric and nonparametric estimators. Finally, the data set analysis and concluding remarks are given.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Additive partial linear models with autoregressive symmetric errors and its application to the hospitalizations for respiratory diseases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shu Wei Chou Chen","Luis A.

The variation in the increasing number of cases depends greatly on climatic seasonal effects, socioeconomic factors, and pollution. Therefore, understanding these variations and obtaining precise forecasts allows health authorities to make correct decisions regarding the allocation of limited economic and human resources. We aimed to model and forecast weekly hospitalizations due to respiratory conditions in seven regional hospitals in Costa Rica using four statistical learning techniques (Random Forest, XGboost, Facebook's Prophet forecasting model, and an ensemble method combining the above methods), along with 22 climate change indices and aerosol optical depth as an indicator of pollution. Models were trained using data from 2000 to 2018 and were evaluated using data from 2019 as testing data. During the training period, we set up 2-year sliding windows and a 1-year assessment period, along with the grid search method to optimize hyperparameters for each model. The best model for each region was selected using testing data, based on predictive precision and to prevent overfitting. Prediction intervals were then computed using conformal inference. The relative importance of all climatic variables was computed for the best model, and similar patterns in some of the seven regions were observed based on the selected model. Finally, reliable predictions were obtained for each of the seven regional hospitals.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Forecasting hospital discharges for respiratory conditions in Costa Rica using climate and pollution data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XXIV Simposio Internacional de Métodos Matemáticos Aplicados a las Ciencias (XXIV SIMMAC)\nJornada de Investigación.

Significant challenges such as climate change, the burden on health systems, and the rise of insecticide resistance highlight the need to introduce new and cost-effective tools for developing public health interventions. Various and locally adapted statistical methods for developing climate-based early warning systems have increasingly been an area of interest and research worldwide. Costa Rica, a country with microclimates and endemic circulation of the dengue virus (DENV) since 1993, provides ideal conditions for developing projection models with the potential to help guide public health efforts and interventions to control and monitor future dengue outbreaks. Climate information was incorporated to model and forecast the dengue cases and relative risks using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model, from 2000 to 2021, in 32 Costa Rican municipalities. This approach is capable of analyzing the spatio-temporal behavior of dengue and also producing reliable predictions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bayesian spatio-temporal model with INLA for dengue fever risk prediction in Costa Rica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yury E.

This study focuses on Costa Rica, a country characterized by diverse microclimates nearby, where dengue has been endemic since its introduction in 1993. Using wavelet coherence and clustering analysis, we performed a time-series analysis to uncover the intricate connections between climate, local environmental factors, and dengue occurrences. The findings indicate that multiannual dengue frequency (3 yr) is correlated with the Oceanic Niño Index and the Tropical North Atlantic Index. This association is particularly prominent in cantons located along the North and South Pacific Coast, as well as in the Central cantons of the country. Furthermore, the time series of these climate indices exhibit a leading phase of approximately nine months ahead of dengue cases. Additionally, the clustering analysis uncovers non-contiguous groups of cantons that exhibit similar correlation patterns, irrespective of their proximity or adjacency. This highlights the significance of climate factors in influencing dengue dynamics across diverse regions, regardless of spatial closeness or distance between them. On the other hand, the annual dengue frequency was correlated with local environmental indices. A persistent correlation between dengue cases and local environmental variables is observed over time in the North Pacific and the Central Region of the country’s Northwest, with environmental factors leading by less than three months. These findings contribute to understanding dengue transmission’s spatial and temporal dynamics in Costa Rica, highlighting the importance of climate and local environmental factors in dengue surveillance and control efforts.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Common patterns between dengue cases, climate, and local environmental variables in Costa Rica; A wavelet approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Jornada de Investigación.

In other words, RCMs use atmospheric and oceanic climate output from general circulation models (GCM) to develop a higher resolution climate output. They are computationally demanding and, depending on the application, require several orders of magnitude of compute time more than statistical climate downscaling. In this article, we describe how to use a spatio-temporal statistical model with varying coefficients (VC), as a downscaling emulator for a RCM using VC. In order to estimate the proposed model, two options are compared; INLA, and varycoef. We set up a simulation to compare the performance of both methods for building a statistical downscaling emulator for RCM, and then show that the emulator works properly for NARCCAP data. The results show that the model is able to estimate non-stationary marginal effects, which means that the downscaling output can vary over space. Furthermore, the model has flexibility to estimate the mean of any variable in space and time, and has good prediction results. INLA was the fastest method for all the cases, and the approximation with best accuracy to estimate the different parameters from the model and the posterior distribution of the response variable.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Spatio-temporal downscaling emulator for regional climate models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XII Foro Internacional de Estadístsica, Facultad de Estadística e Informática, Universidad Veracruzana, México.\n","date":1684774800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1684774800,"objectID":"e89fbda3a2e8d7d80ad9a7cda57a96d8","permalink":"https://shuwei325.github.io/es/talk/conference-2023-05-xalapa/","publishdate":"2023-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/es/talk/conference-2023-05-xalapa/","section":"talk","summary":"XII Foro Internacional de Estadístsica, Facultad de Estadística e Informática, Universidad Veracruzana, México.","tags":[],"title":"Modelos predictivos aplicados a datos climáticos y dengue.

Dengue fever is a vector-borne disease affecting millions yearly, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. Driven mainly by social and environmental factors, dengue incidence and geographical expansion have increased in recent decades. Therefore, understanding how climate variables drive dengue outbreaks is challenging and a problem of interest for decision-makers that could aid in improving surveillance and resource allocation. Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach. Models use a training period from 2000 to 2020 and predicted climatic variables obtained with a vector auto-regressive model. Results show reliable projections, and climate variables predictions allow for a prospective instead of a retrospective study.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing dengue fever risk in Costa Rica by using climate variables and machine learning techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XV Jornadas de Análisis Estadístico, Escuela de Estadística, UCR.\n","date":1661533200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1661533200,"objectID":"65108fc3d648209b616403500f30c041","permalink":"https://shuwei325.github.io/es/talk/conference-2022-08-jornadas-estadistica/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/es/talk/conference-2022-08-jornadas-estadistica/","section":"talk","summary":"XV Jornadas de Análisis Estadístico, Escuela de Estadística, UCR.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de los riesgos de dengue en Costa Rica mediante el uso de variables climáticas y técnicas de aprendizaje automático.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paola Vásquez","Fabio Sanchez","Luis A.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
